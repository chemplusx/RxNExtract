Add 5.0 g of benzoic acid to 100 mL of hot water and stir until dissolved.
Combine 10 mL of acetic acid with 15 mL of methanol in a round-bottom flask.
Heat the mixture of benzene and aluminum chloride to reflux for 4 hours.
Cool the reaction mixture in an ice bath and filter the precipitated crystals.
Wash the product with cold water and dry in a vacuum oven at 60Â°C.
Dissolve 2.5 g of sodium hydroxide in 50 mL of distilled water.
Add the solution dropwise to the stirring organic layer over 30 minutes.
Extract the aqueous layer with diethyl ether three times (25 mL each).
Concentrate the combined organic extracts under reduced pressure.
Recrystallize the crude product from hot ethanol to obtain pure crystals.
